```

This directory provides tooling to get you started with analysing stop and search data with R.  It uses the data in the parent directory's sqlite database.

## Data Sources

* The data as described in the parent directory
* [martinjc's UK-GeoJSON](https://github.com/martinjc/UK-GeoJSON/json/electoral/eng/wards.json)

## Usage

The `01-load.R` file is used to create an Rdata dump of the sqlite database in the parent directory, perform some minor cleaning, and save it to `./data/stop_and_search.Rdata`

You can use this data as follows:


```{r}
load("data/stop_and_search.Rdata")
```

You can then start plotting things with it:

```{r}
dotchart(table(stop_and_search$Gender), main="Self-reported ethnicity")
```
